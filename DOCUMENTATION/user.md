    - RAM: total memory, used memory and remaining free memory
    - CPU: CPU usage
    - IP: IP address
    - Name: machine name
    - Send commands to machine servers:
        - Connection information: IP, machine name
        - Kill: kills the server
- In addition, the interface will allow to send commands given by
  the user, for example:
 
    - DOS:dir
    - DOS: mkdir foo
    - Linux:ls -la
    - python --version
    -ping </pre>

The button on the GUI will return some of this request to the user
