## Intro

The application can be divided into two parts.
On the right side of the window are the general commands that the client can send:
-bone
-name
-ip etc.
The central part is divided into two parts, a large window that allows you to display the results of the various commands and a lower part to enter all of the desired commands. Finally, the right part contains the set of disconnection and clear commands as well as help and information on using the Server.

You had an overview that will allow you to better understand the structure of the application (DOCUMENTATION\GUI.png).


## How is my code structured?

### Server
We can see that the server is divided into several parts. The first where we find the imports of the packages, the second where we find the global variables (forts, host) and the declaration of certain variables which we then used to display different parameters such as the ram or the cpu, and the last where we find the main code and the conditions that allowed us to send the right answers to the client.



### The user


On the client, we find first the imports, second the variables concerning the commands, third the different parameters of the GUI each button its type and its name.


Then, we modify the display of its buttons by modifying the general aspect of the interface as we please.


Follow the placement of the buttons and the actions of the latter, after which come the various functions of the interface.


Finally, we have the window that allows us to display the statistics of our server’s memory.




As well as the part that launches the application, that is the __name__ == "__main__": .


## what did i not do ?

I did the intermediate project. So I did the server and the client, in the form of a graphical application. You can click on the buttons in the application to perform the commands.
I didn’t manage to do the hard part however, I was able to display the graph on the use of CPU and RAM. So I made an application that allows to connect only one client to the server.

I found this SAE very interesting and rewarding and I really would have liked to complete it.
So I’m going to try to work on it in my spare time to get even more skills.
